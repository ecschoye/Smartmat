# * NOTE: there is NO deployment of created artifacts in this case, because every student doesn't have an own server/VM,
#   and to the best of my knowledge, there is no Docker repository running at IDI (yet) for us to use.

# This is a particularly nasty way of generating a PDF of the wiki, due to how much it downloads/installs.
# Therefore, the only way to run it, is to push the "Run pipeline" button (CI/CD -> Pipelines) in the web UI.
# It's also commented out, since we don't really want it enabled until we need it (ie. at the end of the project),
# to ease the taxing the of build servers.
# DO NOTE: the PDF produced will not be perfect, since reflowing HTML to PDF perfectly isn't really possible, so 
# there will be some aestethic blemishes, but it should do just fine for our use case.

# The artifact produced can be downloaded from the CI/CI -> Piplines page, and is called "generatepdf"
